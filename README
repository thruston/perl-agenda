Agenda
------

A collection of functions useful for making printable calendars and diary pages, 
based on Perl's DateTime family. 

The modules are:

        Agenda::Astro - sun, moon functions

        Agenda::Profile - functions for creating and reading simple user
                profiles for calendars.  A sample profile is included
                as cal-sample.cfg

        Agenda::PostScript - functions for creating DSC conforming
                PostScript output (useful if you want to print your
                calendars)

        Agenda::Day - an object representing a day in the calendar

        Agenda::Calendar - an object representing a collection of days

        Agenda::Fortune - a simple implementation of `fortune` to get mottos

There are also some example scripts included that will generate
calendars using these modules.  Principally a-week.pl

Try:  perl a-week.pl -a > temp.ps

to get a weekly diary page for next week with Sun & Moon times shown.
You need to set up a file called agenda.cfg in the current directory.
